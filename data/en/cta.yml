  title : "Welcome to Aggregate Computing Group"
  content : "Aggregate programming provides an alternate approach to the standard device-centered development methodology, 
  aiming to dramatically simplify the design, creation, and maintenance of complex and large scale software systems, 
  specifically in the context of IoT, cyber-physical systems, pervasive computing, robotic swarms, and large-scale 
  situated systems in general. Under this approach, the reference computing machine is no longer the single device, 
  but is instead the aggregate collection of devices that cooperatively carry out a computational process."
